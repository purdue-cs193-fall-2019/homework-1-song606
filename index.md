# Danny Song's First CS193 Homework
- Coding and programs
- and stuff that's real recent
- All in a class with a size that's half-decent
- We needed a less stressful class here somewhere
- This is that song, yes I really went there

- I'd love to keep that up but there's no way I can do that while actually going into proper detail
- The TA's are upperclassmen who are friendly and know how to talk with us
- The classroom isn't a massive lecture hall of 300 people so it's less intimidating
- Work is lighter on our shoulders
